Presently there exists no real "migration" features for moving data from an older database to a newer version.
All data is wiped out each time the migration is performed.
This is fine for development and testing, but once users start actually registering accounts
we need to be able to make changes to the database without losing those accounts.

A table listing all the departments should be created and used with drop down lists
everywhere that currently uses text input for collecting the department information.
Additionally, each department should have associated admin accounts tied to them for approving trips.
